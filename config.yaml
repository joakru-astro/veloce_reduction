# primary information for the reduction
reduce: night # what to reduce options: 'run', 'night', or 'file'; run will reduce all dates in provided directories.
date: '230826' # date of the observation (YYMMDD), if 'reduce' is 'night' or 'file'
filename: 26aug20146.fits # name of the file to reduce, if 'reduce' is 'file'
science_targets: 'Default' # file containing a list of science targets, 'Default' will use all science frames in the night/run
calib_type: arcTh # Wavelength calibration to use SimLC, arcTh or Static (not recommended), other possibilieties are not implemented: SimThXe, Interpolate_LC, Interpolate_Th
# secondary information for the reduction
use_log: False # True or False, if True the code will use the log files to identify the files
arm: red # Which arm to reduce 'all', 'red', 'green' or 'blue'
amplifier_mode: 4 # 2 or 4
validate_trace: True # True or False, if True the code will cross-correlate FibFlat with reference to determine offset of the trace(s)
sim_calib: True # Flag indicating if the simultaneous calibration was used True or False
plot_diagnostic: True # True or False
scattered_light: False # try to remove scattered light (background) True or False
flat_field: False # these are fiber flats (white light fiber spectrum) used for pixel sensitivity True or False

# part responsible for the paths
input_dir: Data/Raw/CSV_Run # path to the directory with raw data (one in which the run directory is, i.e. input directory)
output_dir: Data/Extracted/CSV_Run # path to the directory where extracted data will be stored (i.e. output directory)

# below are paths where code will store intermediet files and diagnostics
# by default they are set as subdirectories of output directory with extracted data
# blaze_dir: Default
master_dir: Default # directory for master images for night/run
wavelength_calibration_dir: Default # directory for wavelength calibration related files for the night/run
trace_shift_dir: Default # directory for results of traces shifted to new position
plot_dir: Default # directory for diagnostic plots

# below are paths where the code will look for internal files
# leave as default unless you know what you are doing
# veloce_reduction_dir: Default
trace_dir: Default # path to the directory with traces to be extracted
trace_file: Default # filename of the file with traces to be extracted
wave_dir: Default # path to the directory with reference wavelength solution
